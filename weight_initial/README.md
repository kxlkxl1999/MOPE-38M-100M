# üß® FLAME-MoE

This repository contains the model described in [FLAME-MoE: A Transparent End-to-End Research Platform for Mixture-of-Experts Language Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.20225).

**FLAME-MoE** is a fully open Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model suite developed by Carnegie Mellon University. It provides a transparent and reproducible research platform for investigating expert routing, model scaling, and training dynamics in sparse architectures. The suite includes seven decoder-only transformer models ranging from 38M to 1.7B active parameters and reflects production-grade MoE setups with 64 experts per MoE layer, top-8 routing, and shared experts.
